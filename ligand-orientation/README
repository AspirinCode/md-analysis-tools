Determine the orientation of the ligand as a series of moves: x, y, and z
translation; yaw, pitch, roll.  This is done by aligning the backbone of the
protein in each frame to a reference structure, the calculating the 
transformation required to align the ligand in this frame to the ligand in the
reference frame.  This requires the package "PrincipalAxes" which in turn
requires "Orient" to run properly.  Both are available on the VMD website.
