This is the set of scripts used to analyze protein/ligand interactions for 
frustration.  It's complicated, but here is a brief overview:

The main control script is run-master.sh.  This is the equivalent of your
typical "run-me.sh" script, except it is able to run multiple vmd instances
simultaneously.  (This is useful for running analyses on the cluster, which 
has enough RAM to load three VMD sessions per node). To run this script, run:

bash run-master.sh file_with_list_of_files script-to-run

file_with_list_of_files contains a set of trajectories to analyze.  All of the
entries on one line are started simultaneously.  If you put three entries per
line, three analyses will run at once.  If you put one, one analysis, etc.  
You have to specify which script to run.  You also have to specify the run 
script.  Unfortunately, run-me_analysis.sh dies if you load more than one copy,
so it has to be run as single rather than multiple jobs.  Confusing?  The point:
when I run this analysis I run:
 
bash run-master.sh run-list_triplet.txt run-me_vmd.sh 
bash run-master.sh run-list_singlet.sh run-me_analysis.sh

These vmd scripts analyze three aspects of the trajectory: the rotamer of 
residue 41, hydrogen bonds made by residue 41, and water molecules bound. These
data are combined and processed by combine-dihedral-hbond.py.  Settings for this
script are at the top of the script; it takes no arguments.  So:

python combine-dihedral-hbond.py

This will populate the directory "trajectory-data".

The script "frustration.R" can then be used to analyze all of this output.  As of
this writing, that analysis is still in flux, so there is little documentation
except in-line comments within the R script.
